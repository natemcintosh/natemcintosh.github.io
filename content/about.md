Hello World! I'm a data scientist at the CDC's [Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html) working on modeling and simulation for disease forecasting.

My background is actually in mechanical engineering, but I discovered a passion for writing software to solve real-world problems. I've since earned a Master's in Data Science, and now officially hold the title of "Data Scientist."  Data science feels like a good fit for combining problem-solving with the development of useful tools.

## Professionally Related Hobbies
- **Programming Languages:** I'm always exploring new languages! Currently enjoying:
  - Rust (very satisfying)
  - Go (have a love-hate relationship)
  - Julia (so much potential, excited to see it continue growing)
- **Open Source:**  I stay up-to-date with the latest open-source developments.
- **Linux:**  Currently using Fedora with Gnome, but I've also enjoyed Pop!_OS.
- **Puzzle Solving:** I like to tackle programming puzzles:
  - [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
  - New York Times word puzzles (and similar) (wordle, letter boxed, strands, queens (LinkedIn))
- **Statistical Rethinking:**  Slowly working through [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/).


## Things I Enjoy
- Open source software in general. Especially:
  - [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/). I use it *a lot* and can't recommend it enough.
  - [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars). Great API, excellent performance, and the streaming performance is constantly improving.
  - [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/). It's been my default shell for over a year â€“ a real pleasure to use.
  - [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). What an incredible piece of software. Has changed my relationship with python packaging for the better.
- Spending too much time on Hacker News.
- Reading insightful blog posts.
- Starting projects and then ... forgetting about them.
- Reading: Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Historical Fiction, any good novel.
- Running.
- Cycling.
- Triathlons. (The swimming is ... okay).
- Being a dog dad.
- A little gaming now and then.

## Things I'm currently learning and working on (as of August 2025)
- Concurrent programming (learning it slowly and with a few bumps along the way!).
- A little bit about computer networks.
- What the heck is going on in the world of AI.
- Trying to write more consistently.
